Version: 0.1.0
Author: Reed Clark Benkendorf
Maintainer: steppe <reedbenkendorf27@gmail.com>
Description: This package has a single function to calculate Augspurgers Index of Synchrony. This is an unfortunate neccessity as the last packages which implemented this function have since been removed from CRAN for failing builds, or are in manners which do not function on rectangular data.
